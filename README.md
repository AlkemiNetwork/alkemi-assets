# Alkemi Assets

Alkemi Network is bridging CeFi to DeFi, building an institution-grade liquidity network for financial institutions and individuals to access professional DeFi and earn yields on their Ethereum-based digital assets.

## Alkemi EARN
The flagship protocol Alkemi EARN provides a DeFi solution tailored to the requirements of institutions; a KYC/AML integrated decentralized borrowing and lending environment with advanced reporting and risk management features.

EARN provides a way for hedge funds, family offices and individuals to earn yields on their ETH, WBTC, USDC and DAI. Exchanges and custodians can natively integrate EARN’s DeFi yields on their respective platforms via Alkemi CONNECT, the whitelabel solution.

EARN also offers access to a separate KYC-free liquidity pool of digital assets as part of Alkemi Network’s mission to enable anyone to join the decentralized financial ecosystem.
